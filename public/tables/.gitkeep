# IMPORTANT: Copy your XLSX and CSV files here for deployment

This directory is for XLSX and CSV files that will be used in the deployed application.

Before building or deploying:
1. Copy all files from src/data/tables/ to this directory (public/tables/)
2. Example: cp src/data/tables/frame-assembly-1.xlsx public/tables/

Failure to do this will result in 404 errors when trying to access the data files in the deployed application.
